While I am not new to blogging, I was re-inspired by https://www.linkedin.com/in/sasiperi/[Sasi Peri], a coworker, and her new https://sasiperi.github.io/[blog].  This gave me the itch to share my experiences and information with hope of helping others..

Now that I was re-inspired to blog, I had a fortunate conversation with https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-heintz-93821513a/[Drew Heintz].  Drew is a bright young man finishing up his Computer Science and Security degrees from https://rit.edu[RIT].  Drew, shared with me that he did his resume using https://gohugo.io[Hugo].  Hugo is similar to https://github.com/jekyll[jekyll static site generator] only written in https://golang.org[go] instead of https://ruby-lang.org[ruby].

After a little searching, I ran across https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3[Giraffe Academy Youtub Hugo Tutorial]. In addition, I found that Hugo and https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor], one of favorite tools, could be used together, https://rgielen.net/posts/2019/creating-a-blog-with-hugo-and-asciidoctor/["Creating a Blog with Hugo and AsciiDoctor"].

Properly motivated and educated, I set the following goals:

* static site hosted at: https://jshingler.github.io (https://github.com/jshingler/jshingler.github.io)
* Site Source stored at: https://github.com/jshingler/jshingler-blog
* make publishing as easy as possbile and looking great
** Hugo
** Hugo Themes
** Asciidoctor
** Well Formated Code with CueBalls

While I have a good bit of experience building Websites, I am far from a Designer.  Lucky for me, Hugo has https://themes.gohugo.io/[Themes]. After previewing the themes, I landed on the https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-universal-theme/[Universal Theme].  It is a great looking theme with a ton of features, more than I need, and good instructions on configuring them.

From there it was time to give it a shot.

NOTE: Start with https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3[Giraffe Academy Youtub Hugo Tutorial] and https://charly3pins.github.io/post/building-static-blog-with-hugo/[Building a Static Blog with Hugo]

## Install Tools

I'll assume you already know https://git-scm.com/[Git] and have a http://github.com[Github] account.

### Install Go

Hugo uses http://golang.org[go]. https://golang.org/dl/[Installation Instructions]

### Install AsciiDoctor

AsciiDoctor has good installation https://asciidoctor.org/docs/install-toolchain/[instructions] 

NOTE: AsciiDoctor requires ruby



### Install Hugo

I am a Mac guy, so I installed Hugo from the https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#install-hugo-from-tarball[tarball].

## Getting Started

Loads of Credit to https://charly3pins.github.io[Charly3pins] and his posting  https://charly3pins.github.io/post/building-static-blog-with-hugo/[Building a Static Blog with Hugo]

### Create Empty Site

```source,bash
hugo new site jshingler

Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /Users/jshingler/temp/hugo/jshingler.

Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>/<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.
```

results in:

### Setup a Theme

.Because we are good devs, initialize git
```source,bash
cd jshingler
git init
```

I chose the https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-universal-theme/[Universal Theme] from the https://themes.gohugo.io/[Hugo Themes] you choose what you like best.

```source,bash
git clone https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme.git themes/hugo-universal-theme
```

WARNING: Don't for get to push the source back to your git repository. For me that is: https://github.com/jshingler/jshingler-blog.

NOTE: As Charly3pins points out in his blog, you can also set your theme up as a submodule.

NOTE: If you haven't already done it, ... Do yourself a favor, watch the https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3[Giraffe Academy Youtub Hugo Tutorial]

Explore the theme, ... A really good place to look is the example site.  You can find it at: ```themes/hugo-universal-them/exampleSite```

### Tune the Theme

The universal theme is pretty robust, ... It has a lot of features that I really don't need for a Minimum Viable Product.  The ```config.toml``` file is used to configure the features.

### Local Development

```source,bash
hugo server -D
```

Dash D, ```-D```, allows draft content to be servered,  Now, check it out http://localhost:1313

#### Add Content

```source,bash
hugo new blog/creating-this-site.adoc
```

results in:

.Default front matters
[source,asciidoc]

<1> date the document was created
<2> it starts as a draft.

The theme supports additional attributes.

## *STATUS:* Work in process 
I will continue to flush this out.

While I am not new to blogging, I was re-inspired by https://www.linkedin.com/in/sasiperi/[Sasi Peri], a coworker, and her new https://sasiperi.github.io/[blog].  This gave me the itch to share my experiences and information with hope of helping others.

<2> icons for Admonitions (NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, CAUTION, WARNING)
<3> save the current image directory, might need it later
<4> where to find images for this post

#### Tuning CSS

When you first combine the universal themes and asciidoc the results might be a little ugly.  To overcome it, you need to tweek the CSS.  To do this, you will need to copy the ```themes/hugo-universal-theme/layouts/partials/head.html``` to ```layouts/partials/head.html```.

.Add this snippet to the head.html file
[source,linenums]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jshingler/jshingler-blog/master/layouts/partials/head.html[tag=customcss]
----

This code will iterate through an array of css files defined in the ```config.toml``` file

.Define an array of custom css
[source]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jshingler/jshingler-blog/master/config.toml[tag=customcss]
----

Next, I copied the default Asciidocter style sheet and saved it as ```static/css/custom.css```.  This file is way to big to include, you can find my tweeked version https://github.com/jshingler/jshingler-blog/blob/master/static/css/custom.css[here].



#### Code Formatting

Okay, truth be told, getting code formatting working was a little harder than expected.  There are a variety of reasons but here is how I got it working.

I looked at a variety of formatters.

- coderay
- prisim
- highlights.js
- https://github.com/google/code-prettify[Google Code Prettify]

I decided to use https://raw.githack.com/google/code-prettify/master/styles/index.html[Google Code Prettify - Sons of Obsidian] style.

The previous section showed the how to declare the syntax highlighter to use.  There is one additionl step.  The corresponding javascipt file need to be imported. 

1. Copy ```themes/hugo-universal-theme/layouts/partials/scripts.html``` to ```layouts/partials/scripts.html```
2. Add the javascript declaration to the file

[source,html]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jshingler/jshingler-blog/master/layouts/partials/scripts.html[tag=codeformat]
----

#### Includes
By default, asciidoctor will turn included external urls into links instead of including them.  This can be overcome on the command line as ```asciidoctor -a allow-uri-read myfile.adoc```.  But we aren't using asciidoctor directly, hugo is calling it an we have no way to set the flag.  There is a creative work around, okay hack.  Create an asciidoctor bash script that adds the flag and make sure the asciidoctor bash script is first in your $PATH.

CAUTION: This can cause a security issue.  *You must really trust what you are including.*  My advice is that unless you control the file being included, don't include it.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
${HOME}/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.4.0/bin/asciidoctor -a allow-uri-read $*
----

.Sample including a portion of the ```config.toml``` file
```source,linenums
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jshingler/jshingler-blog/master/config.toml[tag=features]
```

### Publish to Github

Some really good instructions from the Hugo docs on https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#types-of-github-pages[Publishing to Github.io] and more information on the https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#user--organization-pages[github help pages]

WARNING: Github pages have https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#usage-limits[usage limits], I might have to figure out a different hosting option.

I choose to use a user page https://jshingler.github.io. Make sure you have created ```<USERNAME>.github.io``` (E.g. https://github.com/jshingler/jshingler.github.io) repository on the github website. This is where the static content will be published to and served from.  While it might be tempting, *NEVER DIRECTLY MODIFY THE STATIC SITE*, always republish from the your hugo blog repository.

> Finally you need to add the <USERNAME>.github.io repo inside the public folder as a git submodule in order to update your website once you regenerate the site.
> -- Charly3pins

```source,bash
git submodule add -b master https://github.com/jshingler/jshingler.github.io.git public
```


Now publish the website.  Here is a slightly modified script from Charly3Pin's blog to publish the site.

.deploy.sh - slightly modified from Charly3Pins
```source,bash
#!/bin/bash
set -x

echo -e "\033[0;32mDeploying updates to GitHub...\033[0m"

# Remove old Stuff  <1>
cd public
rm -fr *
cd .. 

# Build the project.
hugo # if using a theme, replace with `hugo -t <YOURTHEME>`

# Go To Public folder
cd public

# Add changes to git.
git add .

# Commit changes.
msg="rebuilding site `date`"
if [ $# -eq 1 ]
  then msg="$1"
fi
git commit -m "$msg"

# Push source and build repos.
git push origin master

# Come Back up to the Project Root
cd ..
```

<1> If you delete something from the site, if you really want it to be delete, you need to clean out the ```public``` directory.

## Additional Steps

That is pretty well it.  I now have a functional blog published to github.io.  I won't go into the details, here are some additional steps I performed, most of which where in the ```config.toml``` file

* Enable Google Maps
* Enable Google Analytics
* Submit for Google Indexing
* Enable Disqus
* Enable ContactMe Formspree


## What's Next

René at his https://rgielen.net/about/[blog] has a pretty good article about 
https://rgielen.net/posts/2019/creating-a-dockerized-hugo-asciidoctor-toolchain/[Creating a Dockerized Hugo + AsciiDoctor Toolchain].  Next, I am thinking about using this with https://help.github.com/en/actions[GitHub worksflows and actions] to that when I push a change to the master branch of my repository, the website is automatically rebuilt and published.
