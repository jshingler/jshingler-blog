Operating with "Structural Integrity" is required to be a breakout performer

I have always been a attracted to Personal Improvement.  From the earlies days of my career, I kept a personal 
journal of my experiences, problems encoutered, and ways to solve the problem.  Whenever I figured something out,
I wrote it down for my future self.  

As I progressed in my career and had more and more demands, my existing systems of keeping track of everything started failing.
I had stuff slipping through the cracks.  UGH!!!

In the past, I have read David Allen's book https://gettingthingsdone.com/["Getting Things Done"]. This is one of the earliest books I read on Personal Productivity and Improvement.  I really liked the ideas and advice but was never able to really stick with it.  https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjcarpenterjr/[Ron Carpenter], a co-worker, recommended Michael Hyatt's book https://freetofocus.com/["Free to Focus"].  This book has a ton of great advice and helped me with strategies to manage my work load and calendar.  I have been pretty pleased with the results.  There is a corresponding planner based system.  I did this for a while and it worked pretty well.  The issue I had was that in today's super busy world, it was manually intense and took a lot of time.  So, YouTube to the rescue.

While looking for ideas I stumbled across Tiago Forte's work, https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/["Building a Second Brain (BASB)"].  For a couple of weeks, I watched every video and read every article I could find.

About this time, I ran across https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffSu[Jeff Su's YouTube Channel].  His explaination of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ql1CQfxWxQ["Inbox Zero"] was a game changer.   He explained it in a way that makes a ton of sense.  With a little bit of effort, I was able to apply the idea to both Gmail and Outlook work email, WIN!!!


And then a very fortune accident, I discovered August Bradley's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-TYSah25UM["My Notion Life Operating System Overview"] work on YouTube.

*BINGO*, .... This was it, ... It was *Exactly what I was looking for*.

August's https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfqj2oq6LVmR3ybC2nfjqKg[Pillars, Pipelines, and Vaults (PPV)] Youtube Channel is a gold mine of material.  It is obvious that August has spent a good deal of time thinking about Personal Productivity and Knowledge Management.  August takes a Whole Life Systemic approach, applying "Systems Thinking" to all aspects of your life.   August implemented the PPV Life Operating System using http://Notion.so[Notion] and shares Notion Templates that are the core of the system.  BTW, Notion is availble and a web app, and app on most systems.

I can't say enough good about about August Bradley's Notion Life Operating System.  It has brought me peace of mind.  Thank You August.

PPV on Notion is my Cheat.  It is my knowledge base.  I wish I had this years ago.  It covers all aspects of your life (Family, Friends, Career, Personal Goals and Outcomes); includes the required habits, processes, and routines; and eliminates the manual work of my previous approaches.  And Now, we have the Notion API, Oh My!  PPV can be integrated with your other tools and processes.

Hopefully, you are interested enough to invest in yourself and spend sometime learning from August Videos.

Below is a list of Notion Life Operating Systems Video you should peruse and learn from.
